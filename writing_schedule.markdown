#Writing Schedule
##Day 1 - Tuesday (TODO: collect data on how many words result from this on average)
- Start with a list of topics (draftin, audience interaction, safari research, old blog posts)
- Pick one topic. Make into headers:
    1. Who are we targeting? What are we going to teach them? Gut check: is it worth their time to read?
    2. What is the dream or path to get this value?
    3. What is the specific action to take?
    4. What are some audience (SEO) keywords to be included in your bullet points or headers?
    5. Come up with bullet points for each header

##Day 2 - Wednesday (goal is 1000+ words, TODO: How long does this take?)
- Write a rough (sloppy) draft for each header section using the bullet points.  
- First section is usually the only 'I' section.
- Include research.

##Day 3 - Thursday
- Take several passes to polish writing:
    1. Read text out loud to see if it flows and sounds like you're having a conversation with the person you target with your main header.
    2. Restrict paragraphs to 4 or less sentences.
    2. Restrict sections to 4 or less paragraphs. Even if one paragraph is just a sentence.
    2. Question every sentence to see if it supports what you're trying to teach in the main header. This is where you also move around content.
    2. Check your versus you’re.
    3. Check it versus it’s.
    4. Check statements for being empathetic versus being talked down to
    5. run it through the hemingway app

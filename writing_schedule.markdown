#Writing Schedule
##Day 1 Brainstorming/Mindmapping - (2 hours or 4 pomodoros max)
- Start with a list of topics (draftin, audience interaction, safari research, old blog posts)
- Pick one topic. Make into headers:
    1. Who are we targeting? What are we going to teach them? Gut check: is it worth their time to read?
    2. Where are they in their journey as a freelancer?
    2. What is the dream or path to get this value?
    3. What is the specific action to take?
- What are some audience (SEO) keywords to be included in your bullet points or headers?
- Write down every idea that comes to mind.
- Note any article associated with the idea (for points and counter points)
- BONUS: Write a super rough draft that covers all the points.


##Day 2 Research/Revisions - Wednesday
### 2 hours or 4 pomodoros max
- Write a rough (sloppy) draft for each header section using the bullet points.
- First section is usually the only 'I' section. The personal story to connect with reader's pain.
- The second section is the proof, research and other stories to connect with the reader's dream.
- The final section is the lesson/dream/fix section. It is the main section for providing the reader with value.
- Research to find supporting or counter evidence from various watering holes.
- Revise with research to help the story.

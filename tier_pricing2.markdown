The other day my wife and I went to the movies to checkout Guardians of the Galaxy. As we walked out I noticed that I was about to toss out my still half full drink. And I realized this is a common pattern I take at the movies: order a medium drink and medium popcorn combo, eat all the popcorn while sipping the drink, and then tossing half a soda as we walked out.

This got me thinking about how the theaters have Jedi Mind Tricked me into always buying the combo despite me always throwing out a quarter of it's value. What I learned are three tricks that you can bring back to your freelance proposals:

##Trick Number 1 - Offer Several Packages
In the theater business most of the ticket profits go to the studios leaving the theaters to really on concessions for profit. Of these concessions popcorn only takes 60 cents to make but can retail for $6, a 900% markup! [http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2010/news/1001/gallery.americas_biggest_ripoffs/2.html]

Theaters take advantage of this concept by using popcorn as the core component in their packages. Suddenly the decision becomes how can you get the best deal on popcorn rather than choosing between popcorn and another concession like candy. My good friend, Brennan Dunn suggests you can do a similar trick with your freelance proposals:

> You see, if you present one rate — like $100 an hour — clients will focus just on that number. But when you pitch a lineup of packages, the Science of Price Anchoring will kick in and people will naturally start comparing you with yourself (i.e., your other packages), instead of you against all of your competitors.

#Teaching Pete How to Use Tier Pricing in His Proposals to Close More Deals
- this is for any level of freelancer. It's a technique post rather than a skill post. It does make the assumption that the freelancer knows how to find and engage with a client.
- the dream is to close more deals. By doing so they get to getting paid sooner and to actual work much sooner.
- The action to take is offering actual tiers or packages in their pricing.
- keywords: clients, proposals, conversion

After playing around with the Destiny bundle I've been shopping around for a PS4. I know, I know. I barely have enough time to write how in the world will I find time for video games? :)

The really interesting thing I found is what turned up after doing a quick google search for the PS4.

INSERT IMAGE HERE

There were three different deals for PS4s! Instead of it being a decision behind which console I was going to get it became a deal of which bundle I would get for what I wanted exactly. A console and a controller was pretty useless to me so why not pick up the bundle with two controllers and a game? No. I never got a PS4. A guy can dream right?

##You Become Your Competition
- instead of a client comparing your offer with a competitor they can compare your offer against your other offers.
- This is like stacking the deck in your favor or increasing your percentages.
- When your own offers are being compared against one another it can appear to the customer like they are getting a deal.

"You see, if you present one rate — like $100 an hour — clients will focus just on that number. But when you pitch a lineup of packages, the Science of Price Anchoring will kick in and people will naturally start comparing you with yourself (i.e., your other packages), instead of you against all of your competitors." [http://doubleyourfreelancing.com/the-3-steps-you-need-to-take-to-start-packaging-your-services/]

"People have trouble comparing different options, but if 2 of the options given are similar (e.g. same price), it becomes much easier." [http://conversionxl.com/pricing-experiments-you-might-not-know-but-can-learn-from/]
##Tier Your Proposal Around Your Customer's Needs
- I'm currently in the middle of a proposal.
- At a base level they need a web app recompiled for their new servers and OS.
- They have other needs as well though such as an upgrade path in the future.
- They also need various levels of support such as on site versus not.
- These could have all gone into one offer but by offering them in separate tiers I give the customer an opportunity to make a decision. You always want your customers feeling like they are in charge.

" Some people will always buy the most expensive option, no matter the price.  You can influence people’s choice by offering different options. Old school sales people also say that offering different price point options will make people choose between your plans, instead of choosing whether to buy your product or not." [http://conversionxl.com/pricing-experiments-you-might-not-know-but-can-learn-from/]

- It's also important to note if your client is looking for an enterprise offer or not. By doing so you can also name your packages to influence the enterprice sale.
" “Names matter.” Back in my time as a Japanese salary man, I was given a project to run by my boss, and I was trying to buy, I think, “Crazy Egg” for it. I did the projection, I wrote up the proposal for my boss, and said, “By the way, we need the $9.99 hobbyist Crazy Egg plan, and could you please approve the purchase for that?” Boss takes my printed out proposal for the project, looks down at “Hobbyist,” goes over to crazyegg.com, strikes it out in red, writes “Enterprise,” picks the top plan, which was $250 or $500 or something a month at the time, something like a quarter of my salary, and says, “OK, here’s the new proposal. Sign off on it, and then I’ll sign to my boss.” I said, “Boss, boss, we don’t need the enterprise plan, our projected traffic is clearly under the hobbyist plan.” He says, “F if I’m going to tell my boss that I want a reimbursement request for the hobbyist plan, so we are under the enterprise plan.” [http://www.kalzumeus.com/2013/04/24/marketing-for-people-who-would-rather-be-building-stuff/]

"If you are selling to businesses, it is very important to understand how purchases are made for your type of product. Learn where the threshold is for companies to spend petty cash versus having to get a manager to approve the purchase." [http://fizzle.co/sparkline/most-common-pricing-mistake]
##Alter Your Proposal Around Your Needs
- what are your current circumstances?
- do you need to take a full time client?
- do you prefer to a client to be part time?
##Questions to Ask in Your Initial Client Interviews
- What is your budget?
- What are you trying to accomplish?
- Include some of the Blumer questions to probe what it is they value.
##What Kind of Things Should You Consider
- This sounds like the same as the altering the proposal around your needs section.

"People base their perceived values on reference points. look at the competition: how they package their offering; what’s the user experience like, and change that. If you look like a new category, people are more likely to pay up." [http://conversionxl.com/pricing-experiments-you-might-not-know-but-can-learn-from/]

"people care as much about being treated fairly as they do about the actual value of what they’re paying for." [http://conversionxl.com/pricing-experiments-you-might-not-know-but-can-learn-from/]
